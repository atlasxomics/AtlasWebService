Bubbles were observed in most red wells during chip loading and were absent in green wells. Initially no mixing, but after vacuum cassette removed, mixing observed in ~3 channels. Perhaps vacuum cassette is too sticky and lifts up chip off slide during reapply. Maybe rerun with less viscous red dye.
